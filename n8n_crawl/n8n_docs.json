Previously, n8n executed the first node of each branch, then the second of each branch, and so on (breadth-first). The new execution order ensures that each branch executes completely before starting the next one (depth-first). Branches execute based on their position on the canvas, from top to bottom. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost one executes first.</p> <p>n8n used to execute multi-input nodes as long as they received data on their first input. Nodes connected to the second input of multi-input nodes automatically executed regardless of whether they received data. The new execution order introduced in n8n 1.0 simplifies this behavior: Nodes are now executed only when they receive data, and multi-input nodes require data on at least one of their inputs to execute.</p> <p>Your existing workflows will use the legacy order, while new workflows will execute using the v1 order.

In n8n, this required structure is an array of objects.</p> <p>About array of objects</p> <p>An array is a list of values. The array can be empty or contain several elements. Each element is stored at a position (index) in the list, starting at 0, and can be referenced by the index number. For example, in the array <code>[\"Leonardo\", \"Michelangelo\", \"Donatello\", \"Raphael\"];</code> the element <code>Donatello</code> is stored at index 2.</p> <p>An object stores key-value pairs, instead of values at numbered indexes as in arrays. The order of the pairs isn't important, as the values can be accessed by referencing the key name. For example, the object below contains two properties (<code>name</code> and <code>color</code>):</p> <pre><code>{\n\tname: 'Michelangelo',\n\tcolor: 'blue',\n}\n</code></pre> <p>An array of objects is an array that contains one or more objects.

By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a <code>/</code> character in the field names, for example <code>Group1/Question1</code>.

For example, if your added the heading to an existing page, you could use the following URL: <code>https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.results[0].id }}</code>. If you created a new page instead of appending a block, you may need to discover the block ID by querying the page contents first.</li> <li>Select Predefined Credential Type and connect your existing Notion credentials.</li> <li>Add an Edit Fields (Set) node after the HTTP Request node.</li> <li>Add <code>heading_1.is_toggleable</code> as a new Boolean field set to <code>true</code>.

Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.</p> Understand pagination <p>Pagination means splitting a large set of data into multiple pages. The amount of data on each page depends on the limit you set.</p> <p>For example, you make an API call to an endpoint called <code>/users</code>. The API wants to send back information on 300 users, but this is too much data for the API to send in one response. </p> <p>If the API supports pagination, you can incrementally fetch the data. To do this, you call <code>/users</code> with a pagination limit, and a page number or URL to tell the API which page to send. In this example, say you use a limit of 10, and start from page 0. The API sends the first 10 users in its response. You then call the API again, increasing the page number by 1, to get the next 10 results.</p> <p>Configure the pagination settings:</p> <ul> <li>Pagination Mode:<ul> <li>Off: Turn off pagination.</li> <li>Update a Parameter in Each Request: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.</li> <li>Response Contains Next URL: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page.

Partial executions need a trigger.</p> <p>This error message appears when you try to perform a partial execution without connecting the workflow to a trigger. Manual executions, including partial executions, attempt to mimic production executions when possible. Part of this includes requiring a trigger node to describe when the workflow logic should execute.</p> <p>To work around this, connect a trigger node to the workflow with the node you're trying to execute. Most often, a manual trigger is the simplest option.</p> <p>Please execute the whole workflow, rather than just the node. (Existing execution data is too large.)</p> <p>This error can appear when performing partial executions on workflows with large numbers of branches. Partial executions involve sending data and workflow logic to the n8n backend in a way that isn't required for full executions. This error occurs when your workflow exceeds the maximum size allowed for these messages.</p> <p>To work around this, consider using the limit node to limit node output while running partial executions.
